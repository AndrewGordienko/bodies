- get test configuration 1 working (check notebook for diagram.)
-- set the first joint to hinge too
-- restrict to only 1 leg per creature
-- custom set the position of that 1 leg 
-- move the leg to correct position
-- choose the correct hinge joint axis
-- move the hinge joint anchor to the correct position (first gotta figure out how to even do this)
- make sure that changing joints from ball to hinge doesnt break the size of the action vector.

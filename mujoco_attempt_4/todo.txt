- get test configuration 1 working (check notebook for diagram.)
X- set the first joint to hinge too
X- figure out the max joint angle clamp that we use in unity, and match that here
X- restrict to only 1 leg per creature
X- custom set the position of that 1 leg 
X- choose the correct hinge joint axis
O- move the hinge joint anchor to the correct position (first gotta figure out how to even do this)
- step by step, with config 2, 3, ... , manually build up the TWO_ARM_ROWER.
- automate this process given the necessary description exported from unity.
- make sure that changing joints from ball to hinge doesnt break the size of the action vector.

- oh yeah check origin in unity or somthing
o update unity debug statements to be our well-thought out everything now.

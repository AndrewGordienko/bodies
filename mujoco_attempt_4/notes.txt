- ok for ankle joint:
-- '1 0 0': dog strafing
-- '0 1 0': dog walking forwards
-- '0 0 1': dog rotating

- ok in unity it's +/- 75 deg angle limit.

- ok I think for the short-term dont worry about the 3 seg 4 seg limits things just export/import them into mujoco, in the mid-term we can worry about that. perhaps wont even be necessary.

- this is acc fun again now lol
- just modify the methods so that it spawn in our creature properly. yea

- ah ok so the position of the Leg is relative to center of the torso. thats it. not normalized to the torso dims or anything, its just world units.

- why are the joint_ranges and similar stuff duplicated across both files..

- the numbers we get from unity are:
-- the segment's unique id (one byte, can just handle as an int)
-- the segment's type id (one byte, can just handle as an int) // maybe easiest just to not use this
-- the segment's size (x,y,z dims) (remember that this is the Unity coordinate system, which is different from the mujoco coordinate system.)
-- the segment's parent's unique id (one byte, can just handle as an int)
-- the segment's parent's type id (one byte, can just handle as an int) // maybe easiest just to not use this
-- the segment's joint type (none, fixed, hinge)
-- the segment's joint anchorpos, if none (none), elif fixed or hinge (x,y,z pos relative to parents origin)


- okk so based on diffchecker, there seem to be 2 main differences.
X- 1. the sensor stuff doesnt seem to be added properly at the end. 
-- 2. the positions are different

- OKK json export from unity seems to work now.
- now,
